# Breast Cancer Data Cleaning and Preparation

## Overview
This project involves cleaning and preparing two datasets for predictive modeling in breast cancer analysis:
1. **Classification Model Dataset**: Predicting cancer mortality status (Alive/Deceased).
2. **Regression Model Dataset**: Predicting cancer survival months.

The data processing is conducted using **Google Colab** with Python and common data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.

## Dataset Preparation Steps

### 1. Load the Dataset

### 2. Handle Missing Values

### 3. Encode Categorical Variables

### 4. Normalize or Standardize Features

### 5. Save Cleaned Data

## Usage
Run the code in **Google Colab** to preprocess and prepare the datasets for machine learning modeling. The cleaned datasets can be used for training classification and regression models.
